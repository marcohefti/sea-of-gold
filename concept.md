# Sea of Gold — Vision Context (Non-Binding)

This file is directional vision only.

Normative order:
1. `acceptance.md` (pass/fail)
2. `GAME_SYSTEM.md` (implemented system)
3. `concept.md` (future-facing intent)

## Vision

Sea of Gold should feel like a single-player pirate economy sandbox where:
- voyages are the center of value flow
- logistics and capacity constraints create meaningful planning
- active play is optional acceleration, not mandatory grind
- politics and long-term sinks give late-game purpose

## Pillars To Preserve

1. Voyages as the hub:
- Port actions should feed voyage readiness, not replace voyages.

2. Logistics pressure:
- Warehouse and hold constraints should stay relevant across phases.

3. Clear progression:
- The UI should always expose the next meaningful goal.

4. Idle + active coexistence:
- Idle progress remains viable.
- Minigames improve outcomes without invalidating idle play.

5. Deterministic testability:
- All gameplay-critical systems stay deterministic and harness-verifiable.

## Future Direction (Optional)

- richer island specializations and route economics
- broader faction identities and campaign outcomes
- deeper fleet routing presets and QoL planning tools
- additional optional minigames with deterministic scoring

These are aspirations, not acceptance requirements.
